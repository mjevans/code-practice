https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Finding_a_year's_anchor_day


<p>You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.</p>
<ul><li>1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.</li>
<li>Thirty days has September,<br />
April, June and November.<br />
All the rest have thirty-one,<br />
Saving February alone,<br />
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.<br />
And on leap years, twenty-nine.</li>

<li>A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.</li>
</ul><p>How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?</p>

So 1900 through 2000 (inclusive) two Doomsday_rule periods.
