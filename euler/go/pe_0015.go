<p>Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right corner.</p>
<div class="center">

<p>How many such routes are there through a $20 \times 20$ grid?</p>

The hint I needed came from LeetCode's rectangle based variation of the same problem, which forced me to think from another angle... looking it up.

I don't often see Pascal's Triangle drawn out as a grid, and the progression of it's sequence is pretty but not so obviously connected to an 8th circle rotation of a rectangle / square, after all it's usually depicted as an equal-lateral or possibly even distorted to render the numbers, triangle; not a right angle at the top triangle.

Rows and Cols start with 0
A row may be calculated in isolation by: (just roll forward)  NOTE: 'forward' might also be backwards since it's symmetrical!
F(n Row, k Index) = (F(n, k - 1) * ( n + 1 - k) / k )
