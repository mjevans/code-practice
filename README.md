# Michael James Evans
## Seeking Employment
### Desired roles: Software Engineer, SRE, DevOps, Network Engineer, OR Information Security
* I enjoy creating, maintaining, and supporting systems and automation which enrich everyone
* Secure, reliable, fault resistant and fail-safe solutions are my passion
* Adaptive and widely versed in computer related subjects

### Practice Projects
Logic Puzzles solved by code and 'redemption challenges' for anything I stumble on in an interview.  Practice of how to write better code, as well as review and revision of any concept.  Though the redemption will focus on the general idea I got tripped up by, not any precise examples.
* [Euler Problems, in Golang](euler/go)
* [Revisit: JSON parse](refresh/jsonparse)
